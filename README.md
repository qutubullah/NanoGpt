# NanoGPT Mini Shakespeare

## Overview

NanoGPT Mini Shakespeare is a text generation project that leverages the transformer architecture with a bigram-based model as a basemodel. This unique combination allows for efficient and creative language generation in the style of William Shakespeare.

## Features

- Generative pre trained Transformer architecture
- Efficient text generation
- Trained on a mini version of Shakespeare's corpus

## Getting Started

## Model Details

The model is built on the transformer architecture, with a unique twistâ€”leveraging a bigram-based model for comparison. This approach combines the efficiency of bigrams with the expressive power of transformers, resulting in a distinctive text generation experience. The bigram is specifically used for comparison purposes. The model is trained on a mini version of Shakespeare's corpus for optimal performance.
